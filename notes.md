import module random 

steps:
create an array with numbers:
[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,]
create an array with characters(alphabet):
[a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z]
[A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z]
create an array with special characters:
[!,@,#,$,%,^,&,*,]

ask for the user the lenght they want the password to be:

randomize the characters based on the lenght of the password


## You have the option of 
## 1. choose a word/passphrase and the program will generate a password 
## (It is less secure but easy to remember)
# 2. Program will create a complex password based on your lenght 
# (Hard to crack yet hard to remember) 
# if user chooses option 1 :
# ask for user word and ask for lenght for random characters
# EXTRA : If specif characters in input = special characters ,
#  replace them with the special characters and number
